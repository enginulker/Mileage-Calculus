# Mileage-Calculus
This project involves managing and forecasting vehicle mileage for a fleet of vehicles under various contracts. The data is split into two main parts: the "Forecast" sheet and the "Vehicle" sheet and determines the possibility of optimizing fleet management and minimizing costs associated with mileage overages or shortfalls.

Forecast Sheet: This sheet provides detailed insights into each vehicle's contract, including key details like contract start and end dates, the vehicle's current mileage, and the expected mileage by the end of the contract. The sheet also calculates whether a vehicle is likely to exceed or fall short of its contracted mileage, which helps determine any associated fees. If a vehicle is projected to exceed its mileage, the sheet suggests a potential adjustment to the contracted yearly mileage to avoid penalties or excessive costs.

Vehicle Sheet: This sheet offers a more straightforward overview of each vehicle in the fleet. It includes information such as the vehicle model, its horsepower, the initial mileage at the start of the contract, the yearly mileage that was agreed upon in the contract, and the vehicle's current mileage. Additionally, it provides an estimate of the mileage expected by the time the contract ends.

The goal of this project is to ensure that each vehicle stays within its contracted mileage limits to avoid additional fees and to propose adjustments to the contract terms if necessary. This type of analysis is useful for fleet management, helping to optimize vehicle usage and control costs by accurately predicting future mileage needs and making informed decisions about contract modifications.
